Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. This project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. We were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The goal of this assignment is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This assignment will:

- create a report describing how the model is built
- how cross validation is use 
- what is the expected out of sample error and why we made the choices we did 
- use prediction model to predict 20 different test cases
